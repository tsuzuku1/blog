## The Essence of TSUZUKU

Two distinct divisions form the heart of TSUZUKU:

### 🔹 Japanese Tea Division
Featuring premium matcha, sencha, and gyokuro, alongside authentic tools — *chasen*, *chawan*, and *chashaku* — to offer a complete ceremonial experience.  
True to Japan, with no compromise.

### 🔹 Healthy Beverages & Light Meals Division
Carefully crafted drinks and meals that energize without heaviness.  
Each item is designed to support health, elegance, and physical balance — all through taste.

TSUZUKU imitates no one.  
It does not blend cultures.  
It is a direct, refined continuation of Japanese aesthetics.

*Founder of TSUZUKU*
