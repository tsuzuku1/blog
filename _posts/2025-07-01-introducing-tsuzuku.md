## The Essence of TSUZUKU

Two distinct divisions form the heart of TSUZUKU:

### üîπ Japanese Tea Division
Featuring premium matcha, sencha, and gyokuro, alongside authentic tools ‚Äî *chasen*, *chawan*, and *chashaku* ‚Äî to offer a complete ceremonial experience.  
True to Japan, with no compromise.

### üîπ Healthy Beverages & Light Meals Division
Carefully crafted drinks and meals that energize without heaviness.  
Each item is designed to support health, elegance, and physical balance ‚Äî all through taste.

TSUZUKU imitates no one.  
It does not blend cultures.  
It is a direct, refined continuation of Japanese aesthetics.
